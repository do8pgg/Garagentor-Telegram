I created this code in 2021 for a friend whose garage door remote controls kept breaking. Initially, the idea was just to control it through a web interface until someone mentioned Telegram. Gradually, the code grew to the point where it worked. It's not pretty. It's not clean. But it does what it's supposed to do.

I just tested it in the Arduino IDE and in PlatformIO, and both compiled it.

The code is somewhat self-explanatory, maybe a bit too long and possibly unclear. But you can manage ;-)

And perhaps it will help you with your project.
